# Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

# Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special 
# abbreviation.

# This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of 
# letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

# Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalizationÂ» will be spelt as "i18n".

# You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be
#  replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.
